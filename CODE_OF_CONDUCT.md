Code Of Conduct
---------------
We expect users to be excellent to each other as well as to provide supportive 
and engaging conversations. We also encourage critical and constructive feedback.
Interactions within this open project are to be respectful regardless of users
background or identity. We strive to pull each other up and to foster an 
environment that *enables* people who find this code useful. Users who are in 
violoation of this code will be warned, then banned from project moderators.
Appeals can be done on a case by case basis. We want this CoC to be straightforward,
so Camoco simply shares the same explicit code of conduct as the 
[Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct).
